## About this code  
The Geant4 code is a simulation using CT images and Phsp file. 

### Geometry  
1) World  
2) CT images (dicom format)  
   
### Source   
1) Phase space file   

### Scoring    
1) CT images (each voxel)

And it has been deeply reviewed by Pedro Arce in December 2007.  
Very small changes by Stephane Chauvie in January 2008.  
Stephane Chauvie, Oct 2009: changed Physics list; changes in DICOM read.   
Stephane Chauvie and Andrea Armando; June 2010 adapted for reading  whatever DICOM file  
Jonathan Madsen, Nov 2013: updated DICOM to utilize multithreading now available in Geant4.10
